The chorus lapilli game is built upon the tic-tac-toe game. 
To begin, since the game requires the player to move its pieces instead of placing down pieces after 
the third move, we can spilt the game into two different phases: placement phase and movement phase. 
To determine what phase of the game we are in, 
	const [placementCounts, setPlacementCounts] = useState({ X:0, O; 0 }); 
As the game progresses, we can update the placementCounts, and if X or O is greater than 3, then we can 
classify the game into the movement phase. Prior to that, the game is essentially tic-tac-toe. 

When the game enters the movement phase, we would need to select a particular piece on the board, and then 
move that piece to a valid square. To handle this, 
	const [selectedSquare, setSelectedSquare] = useState(null); 
When a square is selected in the movement phase, we first check if a square is already selected, if selected 
we need to check if the square contains the right piece. Otherwise, a square is already selected, so we need 
to check the new destination is empty and considered adjacent. But even before that, we need to consider the case 
that the center piece is occupied.
